###Third: incentive-cause bias, both in one’s own mind and that of ones trusted advisor, where it creates what economists call ‘agency costs.’
**第三条：由激励导致的偏见，同时存在于每个人和其所信赖的顾问的脑海中，它造就了经济学家所谓的「代理成本」（agency costs）**

*Here, my early experience was a doctor who sent bushel baskets full of normal gall bladders down to the pathology lab in the leading hospital in Lincoln, Nebraska. And with that quality control for which community hospitals are famous, about five years after he should’ve been removed from the staff, he was. And one of the old doctors who participated in the removal was also a family friend, and I asked him: I said, “Tell me, did he think, ‘Here’s a way for me to exercise my talents’” -- this guy was very skilled technically-- “’and make a high living by doing a few maimings and murders every year, along with some frauds?’” And he said, “Hell no, Charlie. He thought that the gall bladder was the source of all medical evil, and if you really love your patients, you couldn’t get that organ out rapidly enough.”*

之前在 Lincoln, Nebraska 的一家顶级医院中，有一名医生经常提着装了一篮子「一切正常」的胆囊到病理学实验室，五年之后，他被这家以质量闻名的社区医院开除了。

有一位当时参与了做出开除决定的老医生，是家里的朋友。我问他:『是不是这人觉得自己技术不错，通过致残、杀害和欺诈一些人，来施展自己的「才华」，过上土豪的生活？』。

老医生回答说：「当然不是，他认为胆囊是医疗隐患，如果你真的爱你的病人，就要用最快的速度把这个它从他体内取出。」
